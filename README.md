16_D3_Data_Journalism

Worked on analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand your findings.
The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml, but you are free to investigate a different data set. The current data set incldes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

D3 Dabbler
- Created a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as Healthcare vs. Poverty 
- Using the D3 techniques, created a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. 
- Pulled in the data from data.csv by using the d3.csv function. 
- Included the state abbreviations in the circles.
- Created and situated the axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.

Note: used python -m http.server to run the visualization. This will host the page at localhost:8000 in my web browser.
